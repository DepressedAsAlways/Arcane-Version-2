//----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Service Interfaces - GetXXX methods
//----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Mobile-facing service allowing pulling of entities by batch of up to 20 ids
// Visibility is not controlled by EntityService, it is assumed if the caller has id, he/she is
// visible to all elements of the entity.
//
// Typically 4 lists might be returned:
//
//     1. The list of entities (excluding soft DELETED)
//
//     2. retriable_ids: A set of IDs that could not be retrieved for a transient reason.
//                       Clients should retry right away with this set of IDs in order to get the complete list.
//                       Result will be set to Result.PARTIAL if this set is non-empty.
//
//     3. failed_ids:    A set of IDs of those retrieval failed.
//                       Clients should _not_ retry with these IDs.
//                       Result will be set to Result.PARTIAL if this set is non-empty.
//
//     4. not_found_ids: Requested but not found on server or has been deleted.
//                       Not found is not considered failed.
//                       So if you call GetUsers(id1-3) and all 3 ids are not found, you'd have a response
//                       with Result.OK; empty entity list and a not_found_ids of id1-3.
//
// Error Handling:
//     1. Always try/catch rpc errors or anything unexpected
//     2. Response always return a Result tag, you might want to handle error when Result = PARTIAL
//     3. If retriable_ids is _not_ empty, further requests should be made until a response with
//        an empty set of retriable_ids is returned.
